# Autonomous System Documentation

## Overview

This system is designed to be an autonomous, self-evolving entity capable of automating various tasks, creating content, and managing itself with minimal human intervention. Here's how to interact with and manage the system:

### Running the System

1. **Ensure all dependencies are installed:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-socketio abacusai
   ```

2. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python MasterOrchestrator.py
   ```

### User Interface

- **Master Orchestrator Dashboard**: Access at `localhost:5000/`
  - **Orchestrate**: Initiate system orchestration for comprehensive management.
  - **Monitor**: View real-time system performance metrics.
  - **Learn**: Initiate the learning process from user interactions.
  - **Automate**: Automate the creation of automation scripts.
